Group - 112 DXBKIDS
We have chose Topic 2-HELP STUDENTS WITH WORKING AT HOME WITH REFERENCE TO YOUR GROUP'S EXPERIENCE OVER THE LAST YEAR.
Our project consists of several programming languages. Our primary focus was creating a user-friendly front end website inorder to enhance the student experience during these times. The back-end programming was done through library tools of python 3. The library tool we primarily used for creating our back-end was Django.
